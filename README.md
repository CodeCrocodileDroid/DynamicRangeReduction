# DynamicRangeReduction
Python Apps
This app is a Universal Image Viewer built with wxPython that allows users to:

Open and view a wide range of image formats (including JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, WEBP, and more).
Navigate images with zoom, fit-to-window, and actual-size viewing options.
Compress the dynamic range of an image to create a hazy, low-contrast effect (useful for artistic or preprocessing purposes).
Save the currently displayed image—whether original or processed—in any supported format.
It features a clean GUI with a toolbar, menu, status bar, and image info panel, making it both user-friendly and functional for basic image inspection and transformation tasks.
